### Maintainer Scripts

#### `pre_remove`

This function is run before the a package is removed. It is the [Debian `prerm` script](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html).

#### `pre_install`

This function is run before the deb unpacks onto the system. It is the Debian `preinst` script.

#### `pre_upgrade`

This function works just like `pre_install`, but runs instead if the package is already on the system. If `pre_install` is provided but not `pre_upgrade`, then `pre_install` runs as `pre_upgrade`. If only `pre_upgrade` is provided, then it will not run on initial install, but will on every upgrade after.

#### `post_remove`

This function is run after the package is removed. It is the Debian `postrm` script.

#### `post_install`

This function is run after the package is installed. It is the Debian `postinst` script.

#### `post_upgrade`

This function is run after a package upgrade. The same rules from `pre_upgrade` and `pre_install` apply for `post_upgrade` and `post_install`.
