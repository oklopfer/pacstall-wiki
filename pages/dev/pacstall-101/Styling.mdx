## Styling

### Pacscript Name

You need to save your script file as `${pkgname}.pacscript`. To add a package to `pacstall-programs`, fork the repository, and create a directory `packages/${pkgname}`; then, add `${pkgname}.pacscript` inside it. You also must edit the file at the head of the repository called [packagelist](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/blob/master/packagelist), and add your new `${pkgname}` to the list. Finally, create a pull request.

Example of script placement:

```tree
.
├── packagelist
└── packages
    └── foo-bin
        └── foo-bin.pacscript
```

### Remember to wrap everything in brackets and quotes

You can test your package by cd'ing into the directory containing `${pkgname}.pacscript` and running `pacstall -I ${pkgname}.pacscript`. If it works, good! If not, Pacstall should tell you what went wrong.

### Internal Functions

A few internal functions *may* be used, but are advised against unless absolutely necessary:

- The function [ask](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/blob/35a956766dba8f325b24f801d80ac9733efcba70/packages/librewolf-app/librewolf-app.pacscript#L42-L44) will get user input for Y or N.

- The function [fancy_message](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/blob/a7b865490e052e19a34865c07fa3c80c409065fd/packages/android-studio/android-studio.pacscript#L39) will print text inline with pacstall's formatted output.

- The functions `parse_source_entry` and `calc_git_pkgver`, in conjunction with each other, will calculate a commit hash from a source, and return it to `comp_git_pkgver`. Example:

```bash
parse_source_entry "${source[4]}"
calc_git_pkgver && echo "${comp_git_pkgver}"
```

---

### Handling Symlinks
Pay attention to how symlinks are installed in `{prepare,build,check,package}`. If we had a pacscript that looked like this:
```bash
package() {
  ln -s "${pkgdir}/usr/bin/neofetch" "/usr/bin/brokenlink"
}
```

```bash
$ file /usr/bin/brokenlink
/usr/bin/brokenlink: broken symbolic link to /usr/src/pacstall/neofetch/usr/bin/neofetch
```

The reason this happens is because `${pkgdir}` is a staging area that will eventually be removed after the deb is created. You can think of `${pkgdir}` as a temporary `/` for package files.

How we handle it is to pre-suppose the destinations of the symlinks, like so:
```bash
package() {
  mkdir -p "${pkgdir}/usr/bin"
  ln -sf "/usr/bin/neofetch" "${pkgdir}/usr/bin/fixedlink"
}
```
In this example:
 - Our file is currently at `${pkgdir}/usr/bin/neofetch`, but will end up at `/usr/bin/neofetch`, so we make the link to the end destination. We add `-f` for this declaration. 
 - Additionally, because we want our symlink to be contained within the package, we create it inside of `${pkgdir}`.
 - This means created symlinks cannot be run inside of `{prepare,build,check,package}`, only once installed.

---

### Handling User Files
Rarely will you ever need or want to touch the users home directory, and we encourage you to not touch it, however if you *need* to (and only as a last ditch attempt), you can handle files (such as configs, but never application data) like so:
```bash
package() {
  cp -r .config/* /etc/skel/.config/
}

post_install() {
  # Note the absence of sudo
  # Use ${homedir} instead of trying to get the users home directory
  # by trying `/home/$USER` or things in that nature
  cp -r "/etc/skel/.config/foobar" "${homedir}/.config"
}
```
If a package will create a configuration file in the home directory on first run, do not manually create one in the pacscript. If you _must_ modify the user's home directory in `post_install`, `post_upgrade`, or `post_remove`, use the `$homedir` variable provided by pacstall as a substitute for `$HOME` or `~`.

---

### Other

You must not use features that are not in the master branch (latest release of Pacstall).

Pacscripts should ideally be feature complete with their respective PKGBUILDs if available.

Look at other [Pacscripts](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/tree/master/packages) for reference.

For tips on best practices with build tools like `meson` or `cargo`, see [here](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall/wiki/Different-Package-Build-Systems).

Lastly, do not ask the user for any input unless **absolutely** necessary, because we will not accept scripts otherwise. Use external variables to detect what you need to know before asking the user.

As for styling, please use 2 spaces as a tab. You should format all scripts with `shfmt -bn -ci -sr -s -i 2 -w $pkgname.pacscript`.
